// Using Axios

// Use the exercise folder NPM.

// Make sure you have installed NPM properly. You can reference here if you are having trouble with your installation and to get some hints:
//https://jestjs.io/docs/asynchronous
//https://devhints.io/jest

// This folder doesn't have NPM initialized. Create an NPM project and fill in as many fields as you can with information to create the package.json. (Hint use: npm init)

// To prepare for this exercise, we will need to install json-server.

// Run the command: npm install -g json-server

// Run the command: npm install axios --save

// We will be using JSON Server to create a fake REST API.

// Check out the test user data in this folder - users.json.

// Starting JSON server
// The JSON server is started with the json-server, which we have installed globally.

// $ json-server --watch users.json
// The --watch option is used to specify the data for the server.

// Go to http://localhost:3000/users to see all the users.

// Open another terminal to the project folder. Use the curl command to get the user with Id 2.

//  $ curl localhost:3000/users/2/
//    {
//      "id": 2,
//      "first_name": "Song",
//      "last_name": "Gonzalez",
//      "email": "sgo@gmail.com"
//    }
// Getting all users
// Go to get_users.js and complete the commented let res = ... in order to see all users

// Call node get_users.js to see all users.

// Posting a new user
// Go to post_user.js and complete the commented let res = ... in order to post a new user.

// To post a new user, call node post_user.js.

// To add different names for new users, update the params field in post_user.js.

// Call node get_users.js to see if your new user was added or reload http://localhost:3000/users.

// Deleting a user
// Go to delete_user.js and complete the commented let res = ... in order to delete a user.

// Call node delete_user.js to see if your user was deleted. The console should return a status 200. Check your http://localhost:3000/users, to see that user #2 has been deleted.
